      "shortDesc": "This is a family recipe passed along by my late cousin David. It is so simple...just four ingredients thrown in the slow cooker! Not only is it great to come home to a hot delicious meal...your home will smell wonderful too! It is great with the extra gravy spooned over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.",
      "longDesc": "Place the beef brisket into a slow cooker. In a medium bowl, mix together the chili sauce, onion soup mix, and garlic powder. Pour over the brisket. Cover, and cook on the Low setting for 8 to 10 hours. Slice the brisket against the grain, and pour the gravy over the slices."
